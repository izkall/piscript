Developing PiScript has been a deeply personal and educational journey. While the project is currently a solo effort, I'd like to recognize the resources, inspirations, and communities that have contributed indirectly to its creation.

## 🙏 Inspiration

* **Python**: For inspiring the overall simplicity and readability of PiScript's syntax.
* **Pico-8**: For the idea of a constrained, creative environment with graphical output.
* **JavaScript**: For influencing the handling of expressions and functional patterns.

## 🔧 Tools and Libraries

* **Emscripten**: For enabling C code to run in the browser.
* **SDL2**: For powering the PiScript graphics environment.
* **CLang/GCC**: For compiling the core interpreter.

## 💡 Learning Resources

* Online tutorials, blogs, and documentation that guided the development process.
* Open-source projects that demonstrated best practices and creative solutions.

## 💬 Community

To all future users, testers, and contributors: thank you in advance for helping PiScript grow.

This project wouldn't exist without the open knowledge shared by countless developers around the world. Your influence is appreciated!
