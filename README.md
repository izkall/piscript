### Example Script

```python
# A simple script to draw a square
def draw_square(size):
    for i in range(4):
        move_forward(size)
        turn_right(90)

draw_square(50)
```

## Usage üé®

You can run your Piscript files directly from the command line. Use the following command to execute a script:

```bash
piscript your_script.pis
```

### Built-in Functions

Piscript comes with a variety of built-in functions for graphics, math, and more. Here are a few examples:

- `move_forward(distance)`: Moves the cursor forward by the specified distance.
- `turn_right(angle)`: Turns the cursor to the right by the specified angle.
- `draw_circle(radius)`: Draws a circle with the specified radius.

## Examples üñºÔ∏è

### Drawing a Circle

```python
# Draw a circle
def draw_circle(radius):
    for i in range(360):
        move_forward(radius)
        turn_right(1)

draw_circle(30)
```

### Creating a Simple Game

You can also create simple games using Piscript. Here‚Äôs a basic example of a game loop:

```python
# Simple game loop
while True:
    clear_screen()
    draw_square(50)
    if user_input() == 'exit':
        break
```
