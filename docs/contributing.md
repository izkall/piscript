# Contributing to PiScript

Thank you for your interest in contributing to PiScript! While PiScript is currently developed by a solo programmer, community involvement is welcome and encouraged as the project grows.

## Ways to Contribute

Even if you're not writing core code, there are several valuable ways to contribute:

### ðŸ›  Report Bugs

If you encounter issues while using PiScript, please document and report them. Include a clear description, code samples, and steps to reproduce.

### ðŸ’¡ Suggest Features

Have an idea that could improve the language or its tools? Open a feature request! Thoughtful feedback helps shape the future of PiScript.

### ðŸ“š Improve Documentation

Found a typo or think a section could be clearer? Help improve the documentation by suggesting edits or examples.

### ðŸ§ª Test and Share Feedback

Using PiScript for a project? Let me know what works well and what doesn't. Real-world feedback is incredibly helpful.

### ðŸŒŸ Spread the Word

If you like PiScript, consider sharing it with others. The more people using it, the more ideas and feedback we get!

## Future Plans for Contributions

As PiScript evolves, the project may adopt formal contribution guidelines, a code of conduct, and issue trackers. For now, you can reach out directly to the developer via GitHub (or another platform, once it's set up).

Stay tuned for updates, and thank you for being part of this journey!
